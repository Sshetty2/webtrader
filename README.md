# Webtrader

This project was pulled from the byte repository. It uses Python and Sql(SQLite3) for the backend and Jinja templating through the Flask micro-framework for the Frontend. The project is served with Flask. 

In order to ru the project you would simply need to clone the repository and run the following commands in your terminal assuming you have the latest versions of Python3 and pip installed.

(optionally, you can create a virtual environment; I use a virtualenvwrapper) 

$ pip3 install -r setup/requirements.txt

$ python3 run/lib/src/controller.py
